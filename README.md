# Beyond-5G-RIS-mmWave-Systems-Where-Communication-and-Localization-Meet
 PEB and NLOS spectral density (SE) for a SISO system equipped with a single RIS. The BS and RIS are located at $(1,1,0)$ and $(0,0,0)$, respectively, and the user is placed on the $(x,y,-y)$ plane. The rest of the parameters can be found in https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02391.
